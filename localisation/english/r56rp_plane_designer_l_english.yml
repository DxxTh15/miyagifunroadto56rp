 r56rp_aa_rocket_rails_desc: "Current day enemy Bombers are more and more resilitent to small and medium calibre weapons. To remedy this, we can arm our Fighters with large calibre unguided rockets."
 r56rp_aa_rocket_rails_2: "Air-to-Air Missiles"
 r56rp_aa_rocket_rails_2_desc: "By installing state-of-the-art electronics in our rockets we may guide them to enemy air targets dramatically increasing the chance to hit."

 #Engine and Armor Upgrade Tech Localisation
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_1: "Direct Fuel Injection"
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_1_desc: "The technology is quite novel. Mixing the fuel inside the combustion chamber carries big advantages. Our pilots no longer will have to manually adjust the fuel-air mixture being fed into the engines, as well as perform negative G manoeuvrers with confidence that the engine will not stall."
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_1_tt: "Enables Engine upgrades up to 2"
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_2: "Superchargers"
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_2_desc: "By utilising air compressors running off of engine power, we may improve the air mixture being fed into the power plant at all altitudes at the cost of slightly increased weight."
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_2_tt: "Enables Engine upgrades up to 4"
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_3: "War Emergency Power"
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_3_desc: "While our engines are already formidable, our pilots may require more power if the situation calls for it. Various measures have been considered but only a few chosen. Now our pilots can access 120% engine power if the situation calls for it. Continuos operation above nominal levels is not advised as the stress on the power plant is tremendous."
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_3_tt: "Enables Engine upgrades up to 6"
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_4: "High-Octane Fuel"
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_4_desc: "With higher octane fuel we may increase piston pressures, giving us more power."
 r56rp_engine_upgrade_4_tt: "Enables Engine upgrades up to 8"

 ##Airborne Rocketry Localisation
 r56rp_airborne_rocketry: "Airborne Rocketry"
 r56rp_airborne_rocketry_desc: "With rocket motors becoming more reliable and easy to manufacture, we may consider military use for them."

 ##Engine Modules
 r56rp_engine_aircooled_1x: "Air-cooled Piston Engine"
 r56rp_engine_aircooled_1x_desc: "By placing pistons around the propeller shaft we can ensure adequate cooling for the engine without the need for coolant. This however increases the overall drag of the plane."
 r56rp_engine_watercooled_1x: "Water-cooled Piston Engine"
 r56rp_engine_watercooled_1x_desc: "By using liquid coolant, we are no longer forced to ensure air access to pistons. This allows us to place the pistons in a line, reducing overall drag at the cost of increase weight."
 r56rp_engine_jet_1x: "Jet Engine"
 r56rp_engine_jet_1x_desc: "This radical new technology abandons the traditional method of pistons burning fuel in cycles and simply continuously performs the combustion steps in specific parts of the engine. This solution is lighter, and thanks to the high air throughput allows to reach astonishing speeds"
 r56rp_engine_jet_reheat_1x: "Afterburning Jet Engine"
 r56rp_engine_jet_reheat_1x_desc: "By dumping fuel into the superheated engine exhaust, we can increase the engine thrust, for a minimal weight and cost increase. This method is unfortunately terribly inefficient increasing combat fuel use dramatically."
 r56rp_engine_turboprop_1x: "Turboprop Engine"
 r56rp_engine_turboprop_1x_desc: "By taking a gas turbine and using it to drive a propeller, we can reach a much better power-to-weight ratio than a piston driven engine at the cost of lower top speed compared to a Jet engine."
 r56rp_engine_skincooled_1x: "Evaporative-cooled Piston Engine"
 r56rp_engine_skincooled_1x_desc: "A radical idea. Coolant is kept pressurized in the engine, which allows it to remain liquid even when exceeding its temperature boiling point. Coolant takes heat from the engine, then dumps it into special tanks in the wings where in turn the heat can leave into the atmoshpere. This solution promises an almost entirely drag-less cooling system, however since almost the entire plane is used to cool the engine, any hits received will be deadly to the propulsion system."
 r56rp_engine_rocket_early_1x: "Early Rocket Engine"
 r56rp_engine_rocket_early_1x_desc: "Utilizing a number of very volatile fuels and a similarly unstable oxidizer, this engine is capable of putting out a very large amount of thrust to propel a plane to high speeds, at the cost of range."
 r56rp_engine_rocket_late_1x: "Late Rocket Engine"
 r56rp_engine_rocket_late_1x_desc: "Improvements in the combustion chamber and slight alterations in the fuel mixture allow even higher performance, with a corresponding drop in range."
 
 ##Wing Modules
 r56rp_wing_monoplane_straight: "Straight Wing Monoplane"
 r56rp_wing_monoplane_straight_desc: "A single straight wing offers good agility, decent lift as well as reasonably low drag for higher speed flight."
 r56rp_wing_biplane: "Biplane"
 r56rp_wing_biplane_desc: "By having two wings you double the lift surface of a plane, allowing take-offs with less powerful engines as well as improved agility. This comes at a disadvantage of increased cost and a sizeable drag increase."
 r56rp_wing_monoplane_swept: "Swept Wing Monoplane"
 r56rp_wing_monoplane_swept_desc: "Wings placed an an angle, further reduce drag and improve high speed manoeuvrability at the cost of low speed performance."

 ##Wing Tech
 r56rp_speed_wings: "Transonic Wings"
 r56rp_speed_wings_desc: "Reaching the speed of sound may sound like science fiction and it indeed provides a lot of difficulties. Air at such high speeds heats up aircraft components significantly and the transition from sub- to super-sonic speeds is accompanied by a tremendous shock wave."
 r56rp_wing_flyingwing: "Flying Wing"
 r56rp_wing_flyingwing_desc: "Yet another radical idea. By housing all necessary equipment within the main wing, and moving some avionics, we may completely do away with the fuselage and a dedicated tail, reducing drag and increasing fuel efficiency. Such a design is difficult to pilot due to its novelty."

 ##Material Modules
 r56rp_material_wood: "Wood and Canvas"
 r56rp_material_wood_desc: "While Aluminium is preferable, we might be forced to resort to more readily avialible materials."
 r56rp_material_aluminium_basic: "Aluminium"
 r56rp_material_aluminium_basic_desc: "With Aluminium's excellent characteristics we can make our planes lighter compared to their Great War wooden counterparts, as well as more resilient to damage."
 r56rp_material_hybrid: "Mixed Wood-Metal"
 r56rp_material_hybrid_desc: "By cutting down our aluminium usage in non-critical areas we may somewhat cut down the cost of manufacture at the expense of performance." 

 ##Anti-Ship Shite

 r56rp_guided_anti_ship_bomb_1x: "Anti-Ship Glide Bomb"
 r56rp_guided_anti_ship_bomb_1x_desc: "Remote controlled anti-ship glide bomb."
 #Tech
 r56rp_guided_anti_ship_bomb: "Anti-Ship Glide Bomb"
 r56rp_guided_anti_ship_bomb_desc: "By allowing our Bombers to remotely guide their bombs, we may reach unprecedented levels of accuracy against surface targets. This will aid our Bombers in assaulting naval targets from a safe altitude."

 ##Anti-Air Weapons
 #Modules
 r56rp_aircraft_cannon_3_1x: "1x Revolving Cannon"
 r56rp_aircraft_cannon_3_1x_desc: "Single high-firerate aircraft cannon."
 r56rp_aircraft_cannon_3_2x: "2x Revolving Cannon"
 r56rp_aircraft_cannon_3_2x_desc: "A pair of high-firerate aircraft cannons."
 r56rp_aircraft_hmg_3_2x: "2x Fast-Firing Heavy Machine Gun"
 r56rp_aircraft_hmg_3_2x_desc: "A pair of Heavy Machine Guns with improved feed mechanisms spewing out led at a staggering pace."
 r56rp_aircraft_hmg_3_4x: "4x Fast-Firing Heavy Machine Gun"
 r56rp_aircraft_hmg_3_4x_desc: "A quartet of Heavy Machine Guns with improved feed mechanisms spewing out led at a staggering pace."
 #Tech
 r56rp_aa_cannon_3: "Revolving Cannon"
 r56rp_aa_cannon_3_desc: "With airplanes getting faster and faster, our weaponry must keep up. Window of opportunity to score hits on the enemy planes now measure in tenths of a second, and old weaponry cannot keep up. By using multiple chambers to load a single barrel we can drastically increase the firerate of our cannons."
 r56rp_aa_hmg_2: "Fast-Firing Heavy Machine Gun"
 r56rp_aa_hmg_2_desc: "While our previous Heavy Machine Guns have proven to be capable of taking down enemy planes, the volume of fire was found insufficient. Increasing the amount of lead we throw down range heightens our chance to hit as well as deals more damage to more resilient and less maneuverable enemy units."
  
 ##Schrage Musik

 r56rp_aircraft_cannon_4_1x: "Schräge Musik"
 r56rp_aircraft_cannon_4_1x_desc: "Cannons mounted pointing upwards for engaging enemy bombers."

 r56rp_aa_cannon_4: "Schräge Musik"
 r56rp_aa_cannon_4_desc: "By mounting additional upwards-firing cannons in the fuselage, we can safely engage enemy bombers from below."
