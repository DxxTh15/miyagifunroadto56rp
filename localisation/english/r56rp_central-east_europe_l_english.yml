 #### ROMANIAN STEALING
 romanian_expansionism_decision_category: "Romanian Expansionism"
 romanian_expansionism_decision_category_desc: "Much of our time since independence has been spent scrounging for our 'Greater Romania' ambition, unifying all Romanian-speakers behind one flag. The Great War largely made our dream reality, through gaining of the lands of Transylvania and Bessarabia. Despite renewed success, we are yet to reach our potential as the eastern European juggernaut we were meant to be. Trăiască România!"

 hun_core_northtransylvania_desc: "The lands of Transylvania, which has spent centuries under direct Hungarian rule, was granted to the Kingdom of Romania following the Great War. Despite this fact, a large plethora of Hungarian minorities live in northern and central Transylvania, a fact we may use to justify reintegration into our nation."
 hun_core_carpathiaruthenia_desc: "The historically Hungarian region of Carpathian-Ruthenia, which was awarded to the Czechoslovak Republic at Trianon, still hosts a significant Hungarian minority today. With it once more under our control, it can be reintegrated into Hungary proper, undoing this great embarassment to our Hungary."
