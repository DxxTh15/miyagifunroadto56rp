 fra_expanisonism_category_desc:0 "While France's revanchism has waned in the years following the Compiègne armistice, our reach in Europe is faint compared to our days as the Western Europe's chief land power.

 fra_core_cataluna_desc:0 "While Catalonia was never an integral part of the French Empire, it was an important holding.
