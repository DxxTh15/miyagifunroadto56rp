 # R56RP Specific Techs.
 r56rp_specops_combined_1: "Rigorous Training"
 r56rp_specops_combined_1_desc: "By constantly training and preparing for any scenario, our special troops can engage any targets better."
 r56rp_specops_combined_2: "Brutal Training"
 r56rp_specops_combined_2_desc: "Our enemies will not be kind to our SpecOps. We must prepare them for the brutality of war, even if such treatment might be considered “barbaric” by the civilian population."
 r56rp_specops_combined_3: "Modern Training Methods"
 r56rp_specops_combined_3_desc: "With new training methods emerging, our SpecOps forces will not bend nor break against the enemy onslaught."

 ##Engine Tech
 r56rp_jet_engines: "Jet Engines"
 r56rp_jet_engines_desc: "This radical new technology abandons the traditional method of pistons operating in repeating cycles and simply continuously performs the combustion steps in specific parts of the engine. This solution is lighter, and thanks to the high air throughput allows to reach astonishing speeds, at the cost of lower take-off thrust."
 r56rp_jet_engines_2: "Advanced Jet Engines"
 r56rp_jet_engines_2_desc: "Metallurgical improvements allow for much more durable turbines and higher combustion temperatures, increasing efficiency and thrust dramatically."
 r56rp_jet_engines_3: "Reheating Jet Engines"
 r56rp_jet_engines_3_desc: "By dumping fuel into the superheated engine exhaust, we can increase the engine thrust, for a minimal weight and cost increase. This method is unfortunately terribly inefficient increasing combat fuel use dramatically."
