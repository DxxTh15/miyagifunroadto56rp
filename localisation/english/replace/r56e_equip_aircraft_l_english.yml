 AA_rocket_rails:0 "Air-Air Rocket Rails"
 AA_rocket_rails_desc:0 "One hit, one kill." 
 guided_AA_rocket_rails:0 "Guided Air-Air Rocket Rails"
 guided_AA_rocket_rails_desc:0 "The trajectory of the guided Air-Air rockets can be modified in flight, increasing their accuracy."
 improved_rocket_rails:0 "Improved Rocket Rails"
 improved_rocket_rails_desc:0 "Better rockets for better pyrotechnics."

 jet_engine_1x_2:0 "1x Jet Engine II"
 jet_engine_1x_2_desc:0 "An improved jet engine. I can't say more because I spent years modding instead of trying to get an engineering degree." 
 jet_engine_2x_2:0 "2x Jet Engine II"
 jet_engine_2x_2_desc:0 "You know what, let's put two of those bad boys on that airframe... Yeah that will do the trick."
 jet_engine_3x_2:0 "3x Jet Engine II"
 jet_engine_3x_2_desc:0 "No I changed me mind, let's go with 3 engines. I know it's imbalanced, but we can put one in the fuselage or on top, find a way, that's why I am paying you. I am expecting the first prototype in 3 weeks." 
 jet_engine_4x_2:0 "4x Jet Engine II"
 jet_engine_4x_2_desc:0 "Couldn't we make an even bigger airframe take off with four engines?"
 jet_engine_6x_2:0 "6x Jet Engine II"
 jet_engine_6x_2_desc:0 "I love jets, I love jets, get me all the jet engines you can find."

 jet_engine_1x_3:0 "1x Jet Engine III"
 jet_engine_1x_3_desc:0 "By dumping fuel into the superheated engine exhaust, we can increase the engine thrust, for a minimal weight and cost increase. This method is unfortunately terribly inefficient increasing combat fuel use dramatically." 
 jet_engine_2x_3:0 "2x Jet Engine III"
 jet_engine_2x_3_desc:0 "Two engines for twice the jets" 
 jet_engine_3x_3:0 "3x Jet Engine III"
 jet_engine_3x_3_desc:0 "50% more trust than with 2 engines"
 jet_engine_4x_3:0 "4x Jet Engine III"
 jet_engine_4x_3_desc:0 "Four modern jet engines"
 jet_engine_6x_3:0 "6x Jet Engine III"
 jet_engine_6x_3_desc:0 "The greatest number of the best engines around. More and we would have to script a sound barrier news event."

#-> Torpedo bombers <><>
 nav_bomber:0 "Torpedo Bomber"
 nav_bomber_equipment:0 "Torpedo Bomber"
 nav_bomber_equipment_desc:0 "Torpedo Bombers can attack enemy ships."
 nav_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Torpedo Bomber '36"
 nav_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Torpedo Bomber '36"
 nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Naval aviation will be vital in the coming decade to confront new developments in naval warfare, such as the increased importance of submarines. Seaplanes with the capacity to work as dive bombers and recon vehicles will be helpful."
 nav_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Torpedo Bomber '40"
 nav_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Torpedo Bomber '40"
 nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "New engine technology and aerodynamically refined designs will significantly boost the speed and diving attack capability of naval planes."
 nav_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Torpedo Bomber '44"
 nav_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "Torpedo Bomber '44"
 nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "All-metal designs and powerful airbrakes allow for more complex naval aeronautics. However, the planes of the future will demand a larger crew to operate these advanced systems."
 
#-> Carrier-based torpedo bombers <><> #yeeees excellent fucking idea to call CARRIER VARIANTS THE SAME AS LAND VARIANTS.
 cv_nav_bomber:0 "CV Torpedo Bomber"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment:0 "CV Torpedo Bomber"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_desc:0 "CV Torpedo Bombers can perform attacks against enemy ships from a naval carrier."
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Carrier Torpedo Bomber '36"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Carrier Bomber '36"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "An early naval bomber modified to launch from and land on aircraft carriers."
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Carrier Torpedo Bomber '40"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Carrier Bomber '40"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "An improved naval bomber modified to launch from and land on aircraft carriers."
