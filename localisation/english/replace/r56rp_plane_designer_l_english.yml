 dive_brakes_small_desc: "A set of spoilers along the trailing edge of the wing deploy when the plane enters a dive, reducing overall speed and allowing the plane to pull out of steep dives without ripping its wings off. This, in turn, allows the plane to attack from a near-vertical dive, drastically increasing accuracy."
